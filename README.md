## Installation
  
  To install this app clone this repo, then open the terminal and run the following commands: npm i, npm run seed, then npm run dev. This will install all dependencies and start the server. From there, each endpoint can be tested using Insomnia, or something similar.
  
  
## Usage
  
  Since this app has no front end, each route must be tested using Insomnia or another similar application. There are routes to retrieve all information for users, thoughts, and reactions, routes to delete users, thoughts, reactions, or friends by id, routes to update users or thoughts, and routes to create new users, thoughts, reactions, and friends. A walkthrough video of these routes being tested can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/11LzyJ4Vj62OIkytdJ6r3qGg2kW8CVah4/view
